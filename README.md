# Stormshade
## Custom Reshade build + shader preset for Final Fantasy 14.

[Stormshade](https://ffstormshade.wixsite.com/stormshade) is a custom Reshade build compiled using [reshade's](https://github.com/crosire/reshade) latest open source [files](https://github.com/crosire/reshade). It has an unlocked depth buffer that enables it to utilize some of reshade's amazing shaders that uses depth information to work in online games.

> Vanilla reshade disables/turns off shaders that uses depth information automatically once it detects network activity. This is implemented by design to avoid being exploited and used to gain an advantage in competitive online games. The patched reshade build in this repo will only work in Final Fantasy 14.
